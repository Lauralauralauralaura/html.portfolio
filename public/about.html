<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been teaching English as a foreign and second language for almost 15 years and this has enabled me to teach all over the world. 
  However, in recent years l have decided to incorporate technology into my teaching and this interest has inspired me to learn web development
skills, so l can begin to create websites and apps in the future.</p>

<p>Aside from a career that has made it possible for me to live in other countries, experience other cultures and travel, l have just got into 
  cooking and armed with toaster oven, wok and air fryer l am learning to make all kinds of dishes from different parts of the world. My new
  love in cuisine is lebanese.
